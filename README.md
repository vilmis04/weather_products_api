# Product recommendation based on weather forecast API

## Overview

This service is created to provide product recommendations based on weather forecast for the next 3 days. <br>
The forecasts are based on [Meteo.lt API](https://api.meteo.lt/).

## Tutorial

This is the primary part of the documentation.

It should include the different content formats you are using to explain the concept of the API to the user. It can also include links for reference and a step-by-step guide for integrating the API and consuming it so it functions properly.

## Examples

Once you've explained how the API works and/or provided itemized steps, it's a good idea to show examples of calls, responses, error handling, and other operations that have to do with how the developer interacts with the API.

## Glossary

Though this is optional, I recommend adding a glossary page for your API documentation.

To avoid boring the user with long text blocks, explanations of various terms, schemas, images, and so on that you use throughout documentation can all be pushed to the glossary. Then you can reference these things in the documentation, and link to the glossary.
